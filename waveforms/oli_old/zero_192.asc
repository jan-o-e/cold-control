This method download an arbitrary waveform from arrays of Data (short) values,that are already in range from 0 to 16383 in to the both channels(Channel1 and Channel2,Channel3 and Channel4) when trace mode is Double or Combine (only for 4Ch. models).

Function Tree Node: \WX218x\Instrument Specific\Arbitrary\Waveform\Create Custom Adv 
 
Parameters
	Vi 
		The ViSession handle that you obtain from the IviDriver_init or IviDriver_InitWithOptions function. The handle identifies a particular instrument session.
	Data1BufferSize 
		Number of elements in Data1.
	Data1 
		Array of data you want to use for the new arbitrary waveform.You must normalize the data points in the array to be between -1.00 and +1.00.
	Data2BufferSize 
		Number of elements in Data2.	
	Data2 
		Array of data you want to use for the new arbitrary waveform.You must normalize the data points in the array to be between -1.00 and +1.00.
	Handle1 
		Handle that identifies that waveform for the first channel set.
	Handle2 
		Handle that identifies that waveform for the second channel set.
		
Return Value
	Success or failure code.
